Loan Default Prediction Project

Overview

This repository contains code and data for a machine learning project aimed at predicting loan default using artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM). The project involves extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Data: This directory contains the dataset used in the project. It includes two CSV files: lending_club_loan_two.csv containing loan data and lending_club_info.csv providing descriptions of the columns in the loan dataset.

Code: This directory contains code for data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation is implemented. The main file is will_they_pay.py

README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, structure, and instructions for running the code.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not based on various features provided in the dataset. The project aims to assist lending institutions in assessing the risk associated with lending to individuals.

Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow
Instructions
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/KitAndre82/will_the_loan_be_repaid.git
Navigate to the project directory:

arduino

Copy code
cd loan-default-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the will_they_pay.py file using an IDE of your choice. Ensure that you have the necessary dataset files (lending_club_loan_two.csv and lending_club_info.csv) in the Data directory.

Follow the instructions in the file to execute the code. This includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Results

The project evaluates the performance of various machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM), for loan default prediction. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score are used to assess model performance.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict loan default risk. By leveraging features such as employment history, loan amount, credit grade, and others, the developed models provide insights into the likelihood of loan default. The models can aid lending institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan approval and risk management.
